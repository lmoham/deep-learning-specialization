# Supervised Learning with Neural Networks

* Supervised learning:
  * Provide the NN some inputs and its expected output
  * Plenty of applications that use slightly different NNs that are best suited for that task

* Some types of NNs:
  * Standard NN for relatively simple applications
  * CNNs for image identification/detection
  * RNNs for text-based applications

* Brief background:
  * Two types of supervised learning: With structured data and unstructured data
  * NNs make it possible for computers to 1) Deal with LARGE structured datasets and 2) Deal with unstructured data...
    * ...better than previous methods.
