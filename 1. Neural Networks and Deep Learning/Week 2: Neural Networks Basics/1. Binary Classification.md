* Establishing the problem:
  * Let's say we want to identify whether an image contains a cat.
  * Each image will be 64 x 64 pixels
    * These pixels are represented by three 64 x 64 matrices, showing the degree of red, blue, and green of a particular pixel
    * These will be unrolled onto a single feature vector of 12,288 features (64x64x3)
  * Output - 1 indicates a cat is present, and vice versa

* Some notation:
  * x will have nx dimensions (representing the total number of pixels for an image)
  * X will have m by nx dimensions (where m = number of samples in dataset)
  * Y will have 1 by m dimensions 
    * Thus, X and Y both represent the dataset in columns
