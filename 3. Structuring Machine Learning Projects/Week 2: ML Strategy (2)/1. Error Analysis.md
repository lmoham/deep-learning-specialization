* Problem: Classifier is detecting dogs as cats, should we train the classifier to recognize dogs better?
* Hard to tell in advance whether this is worth our effort
  * Error analysis: A method of quantifying how valuable some task is
    * If, through error analysis, we get a few dog mislabels, then it isn't worth our time
    * Likewise, if many dogs are mislabeled, we should definitely proceed as it will increase our accuracy by a non-trivial amount

* If you have multiple ideas, then use a dataset containing the different categories to work with
* Add a checkmark for every misclassified image, sum up checkmarks for each column, then measure the percentage a category takes
  * The bigger the percentage, the more impactful a category is, and should therefore be worked on sooner

# Cleaning up incorrectly labeled data

* If the training set has some mislabeled images, you should be fine..
  * ..if these mislabeled images happened at random
  * If there is some consistency to the mislabeled images, then your classifier will start to classify things incorrectly

* You can treat these mislabels as another category, then perform error analysis
* Is it worth your time to deal with the incorrect label problem? Check the percentages (relative to overall error)
  * Example: 0.6/2 is 30%, which is a sizable chunk of your errors. Definitely consider fixing it in this case

* Some additional things to think about when proceeding w/ the cleanup process
* 2nd point doesn't typically happen because there are so many positive examples to look at
  * It's just something to consider

# Build your first system quickly, then iterate

* Build a simple model quickly then iterate!
  * You can find which problem you need to tackle w/ Bias/Variance analysis and error analysis
    * This is much easier AFTER the model has been built, rather than BEFORE
  * However, if you have expertise in a particular domain or there are plenty of resources for a particular application..
  * ..sometimes teams will start with a complex model
