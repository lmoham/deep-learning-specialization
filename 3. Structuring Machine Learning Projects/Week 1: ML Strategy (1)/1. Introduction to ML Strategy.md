* There are many different things to try when thinking about improving your ML model
* It's hard to decide which will most affect our model
  * If we choose incorrectly, time will be wasted and our model won't improve by very much
  * What should we work on? How do we decide?

# Orthogonalization

* Our ML model behaves as if it applies all TV physical functions simulataneously
  * It would be much easier to use each function separately to center the image on your screen
  * In driving, turning and speed are separate - allows for smooth maneuvering

* Our "knobs" and the respective actions to take for that knob
* Early stopping isn't orthogonal because it affects two things at once
  * Doesn't mean its a bad thing, but using orthogonal methods is alot more straightforward
